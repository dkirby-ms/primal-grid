# **📘 GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT (GDD)**  
## **Title (Working):** *Primal Grid: Survival of the Frontier*  
## **Genre:** Grid-Based Survival • Colony Builder • Ecosystem Simulation  
## **Perspective:** Top‑down or isometric  
## **Target Platform:** Web (browser-based)  
## **Core Fantasy:** Build, survive, and thrive in a living prehistoric world where dinosaurs, ecosystems, and weather systems evolve dynamically — and the player’s colony must adapt or perish.

# **1. HIGH‑LEVEL VISION**

**Primal Grid** blends the survival fantasy of ARK with the systemic clarity of RimWorld and the automation depth of Factorio.  
The world is a **tile-based ecological simulation** where creatures migrate, hunt, breed, and adapt. The player builds a settlement, tames creatures, automates production, and shapes the environment.

The game emphasizes:
- **Dynamic ecosystems**  
- **Creature intelligence & personality**  
- **Strategic survival**  
- **Base automation**  
- **Meaningful taming & breeding**  
- **Player-driven world evolution**

# **2. CORE GAMEPLAY PILLARS**

### **Pillar 1 — Living Ecosystem Simulation**
The world is not static. Creatures migrate, vegetation regrows, predators hunt prey, and biomes shift over time.

### **Pillar 2 — Strategic Survival**
The player must manage food, shelter, weather, and threats — but with clarity and fairness, not ARK’s punishing chaos.

### **Pillar 3 — Creature Interaction**
Taming, breeding, and working with dinosaurs is central. Each creature has personality traits, needs, and behaviors.

### **Pillar 4 — Base Building & Automation**
Players construct a settlement that evolves from primitive huts to complex automated systems.

### **Pillar 5 — Exploration & Discovery**
Ruins, anomalies, rare species, and environmental mysteries encourage exploration and risk-taking.
