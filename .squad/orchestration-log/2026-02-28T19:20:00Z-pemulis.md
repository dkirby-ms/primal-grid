# Orchestration Log: Pemulis (2026-02-28T19:20:00Z)

**Agent:** Pemulis (Systems Dev)  
**Task:** Remove taming/breeding/pawn server code  
**Outcome:** SUCCESS

## Summary

Executed removal of taming, breeding, trust, pack, and pawn systems from server while preserving wild creature simulation as environmental entities.

## Work Completed

### 1. Creature Type System Cleanup
- **File:** `shared/src/data/creatures.ts`
- Removed `worker` creature type definition (was spawned at HQ during taming)
- Removed `personalityChart` field from `CreatureTypeDef` interface
- Removed `speed` field from `CreatureTypeDef` interface
- Removed dangling `Personality` type import from `shared/src/types.ts`

### 2. Server Initialization & Spawning
- **File:** `server/src/rooms/territory.ts`
- Removed `nextCreatureId` parameter from `spawnHQ()` function
- Parameter was only used for generating worker creature IDs

- **File:** `server/src/rooms/GameRoom.ts`
- Removed `creatureIdRef` logic from `onJoin()` handler
- No longer passes creature ID counter to `spawnHQ()`

### 3. AI Module Cleanup
- **File:** `server/src/rooms/creatureAI.ts`
- Cleaned up "Exported for pack follow" comment on `moveToward()` function
- Pack follow system was never implemented; comment was speculative

## Preserved Systems

All wild creature systems remain fully intact:
- Creature spawning and respawning
- Wild creature AI: wander, flee, hunt, graze, eat FSM
- Movement utilities: `moveToward`, `moveAwayFrom`, `pathfindAStar`
- Full ecosystem simulation mechanics
- Server-side creature state schema

## Test Status

- Created 2 test failures (expected, handled by Steeply):
  - `creature-types.test.ts` — asserts `speed` field exists
  - `creature-systems-integration.test.ts` — respawn count mismatch due to `worker` removal
- 197 passing tests (baseline: 199)
- No wild creature simulation breakage

## Impact on Other Agents

- **Gately (Game Dev):** No server-side changes affect client rendering of wild creatures; custom cursor and ghost preview work unchanged
- **Steeply (Tester):** Two test failures require cleanup in test files
