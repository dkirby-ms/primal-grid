# Orchestration Log: Gately

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T17:12:05Z  
**Agent:** Gately (Game Dev)  
**Mode:** background (claude-sonnet-4.5)  
**Task:** Phase 2.3 HUD hunger/health bars

## Status

**COMPLETE**

## Work Summary

1. **HUD Renderer Architecture**
   - Created `HudRenderer.ts` with PixiJS-based rendering
   - Hunger and health bars rendered on `app.stage` (screen-fixed, viewport independent)
   - Bars positioned top-left corner of viewport
   - Color thresholds: green→orange→red based on value
   - Defaults to 100/100 if server hasn't sent fields yet (no glitch, no crash)

2. **Integration with Server**
   - `connectToServer` now receives `app` parameter for HUD stage access
   - Follows existing binding pattern: `bindToRoom(room)` with duck-typed `Record<string, unknown>` state access
   - Automatically picks up `hunger` and `health` from PlayerState (no rebuild needed when Pemulis updates)

3. **Visual Design**
   - Bars use configurable colors based on thresholds
   - Bar width/height proportional to canvas (responsive)
   - Synced to server tick rate (updates per frame when server sends state delta)

## Integration Points

- Pemulis's `hunger` and `health` fields on PlayerState automatically rendered
- New HUD elements (inventory, status effects) can follow same pattern
- Client handles gracefully if server fields are missing (renders full bars)

## Outstanding

- Inventory UI (Phase 3)
- Status effects display (Phase 4+)

## Notes

- HUD pattern established for future extensibility
- No visual glitch on cold start (defaults to full health/hunger)
- Pattern aligns with existing rendering architecture (GridRenderer, PlayerRenderer, CreatureRenderer)
