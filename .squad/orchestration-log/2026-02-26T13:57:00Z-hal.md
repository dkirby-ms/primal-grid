# Hal — Phase 4.5 HUD Redesign (Lead, Completed)

**Agent:** Hal (Lead)  
**Phase:** 4.5 — HUD Redesign  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26T13:57:00Z

## Summary

Hal designed and proposed Phase 4.5 — moving the HUD from canvas-space (PixiJS) to a dedicated HTML-based side panel. Proposal detailed full scope breakdown (4.5.1–4.5.4), architecture decisions, risk mitigation, and success criteria.

## Work Completed

- **Phase proposal written:** `hal-hud-redesign-phase.md` (262 lines, 4 sub-phases)
- **Success criteria defined:** 9-point DoD including layout, data binding, visual polish, testing, and multiplayer verification
- **Architecture decisions documented:** D1–D5 covering canvas resize safety, HTML panel preference, parallel HudDOM/HudRenderer, no new gameplay features, build mode relocation
- **Scope fence documented:** Deferred features (inventory screen, status effects, mobile responsive, etc.)
- **Risk mitigation:** 3 key risks identified (canvas resize, DOM update thrashing, multiplayer HUD conflicts) with mitigations
- **Schedule proposed:** 3-day critical path (4.5.1 → 4.5.2 → 4.5.3 → 4.5.4)

## Integration Points Identified

- **InputHandler:** `setBuildMode()`, `updatePackSize()` API unchanged
- **main.ts:** Remove `app.stage.addChild(hud.container)`, instantiate HudDOM
- **Network:** No server changes needed

## Assumptions Made

- Side panel on right, 200px width, dark background
- Canvas resizable to 600×600 without affecting Phase 4
- HTML/DOM-based HUD simpler than PixiJS panel (maintainability, future mobile support)

## Implications

- Gately: 3-day implementation window, HudDOM new file, InputHandler import change
- Steeply: Anticipatory test plan with 13 HUD state contract tests + manual checklist
- Next phases: Phase 5 (World Events) ready for cleaner layout foundation

## Next Steps

Gately and Steeply execute sub-phases 4.5.1–4.5.4 in sequence.
