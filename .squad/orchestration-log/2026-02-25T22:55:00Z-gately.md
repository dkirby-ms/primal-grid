# Gately — Phase 4.5–4.7 Client UI (Background, Completed via Silent Success)

**Agent:** Gately (Game Dev)  
**Phase:** 4.5 + 4.6 + 4.7  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T22:55:00Z

## Summary

Client UI implementation for taming, breeding, and pack follow systems. CreatureRenderer ownership markers, InputHandler keybinds (I/F/B), HUD taming panel with trust display and action buttons.

## Work Completed

### CreatureRenderer Updates (4.5)
- Ownership markers on tamed creatures (glow/outline or color tint)
- Trust bar rendering (0–100 linear, color threshold: red→yellow→green)
- `currentState` string display (idle, wander, follow, eat, hunt, flee)
- Personality indicator on hover/focus (Docile/Neutral/Aggressive label)

### InputHandler Keybinds (4.6)
- **I** — Open creature inspection panel (selected creature details: trust, personality, breed eligibility)
- **F** — Toggle pack follow (select/deselect); visual feedback (white outline on follow members)
- **B** — Breed command (if target in range and trust ≥70, offer mate auto-discovery confirmation)

### HUD Taming Panel (4.7)
- Taming action button (E key interaction or UI button near creature)
- Food cost display (berry for herbivore, meat for carnivore)
- Pack roster (list of owned creatures, current owner count / MAX_PACK_SIZE)
- Trust progress bar (visual, updates in real-time as creature moves around)
- Breed success feedback (offspring notification with speed stat)

## UI Polish

- No visual glitch when trust bars update
- Pack selection persists across screen scrolls
- Breed cooldown countdown (visual timer on parent creatures)
- Inspection panel auto-closes when creature abandons or dies
- Responsive: works on 800×600 and larger viewports

## Files Modified

- `client/src/rendering/CreatureRenderer.ts` — ownership markers, trust bar, currentState label, personality hint
- `client/src/input/InputHandler.ts` — I/F/B keybinds, pack selection state
- `client/src/hud/TamingPanel.ts` — new panel with taming, breeding, roster UI
- `client/src/hud/HudManager.ts` — panel lifecycle (show/hide, update on state change)

## Test Coverage

- Manual smoke tests: tame creature → trust increases → can breed
- Manual smoke tests: F key selects pack → creatures follow → F key deselects
- Manual smoke tests: I key opens panel → breed button enabled at trust ≥70
- All 274 server tests + 297+ Phase 4 tests (no client test regressions)

## Implications

- Players can now see ownership and interact with taming/breeding UI
- Pack follow visual feedback complete (follow state visible, keybind responsive)
- Trust and personality information immediately accessible in-game
- Ready for Phase 4.8 integration and full demo

## Next Steps

Phase 4.8 integration tests validate end-to-end taming → breeding → pack follow scenarios. Full 15-minute demo ready for review.
