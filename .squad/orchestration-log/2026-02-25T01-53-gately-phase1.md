# Orchestration: Gately Phase 1

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T01:53Z  
**Agent:** Gately (Game Dev)  
**Mode:** background  
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Execution Summary

Phase 1 client rendering pipeline: grid renderer, camera, input, player rendering, Colyseus connection.

### Deliverables

- GridRenderer: renders 32×32 tile grid with tile types (grass=green, water=blue, rock=gray, sand=tan)
- Camera: top-down viewport, WASD pan (continuous), smooth scrolling
- Input handler: WASD (camera), Arrows + click-to-move (player)
- Player rendering: circle-based player sprites, colored by connection status
- Colyseus client: auto-connect to server, graceful offline degradation
- State binding: duck-typed (no schema imports), adapts to server changes

### Key Decisions Logged

- Grid renders immediately with default grass (no server wait)
- Generic state binding (`Record<string, unknown>`) avoids coupling
- Input: WASD=camera, Arrows/click=player with 150ms debounce
- Click-to-move sends absolute coords; arrows send direction
- Player rendering: snap-to-position (no interpolation, deferred)
- Connection failure: offline mode (no crash, no modal)

### Validation

- Client starts on port 3000
- Grid renders offline
- WASD camera panning works
- Arrow keys + click send movement events
- Colyseus connection succeeds when server is running
- Players render when server broadcasts state
- Offline graceful degradation confirmed

**Next Phase:** Gately Phase 2 (creature rendering, animation, visual polish)
