# Orchestration: Hal (Lead) — Unified Build + Claim Design

**Date:** 2026-02-28T19:40:00Z  
**Agent:** Hal (Lead)  
**Mode:** sync  
**Task:** Design unified build + claim mechanic. User directive: remove structures, keep shapes-only.  
**Outcome:** ✅ SUCCESS

---

## What Happened

### Input
- User directive (2026-02-28T19:40:00Z): Remove workbenches, farms, turrets. Build mode = shapes only. No structure placement.

### Work
Designed the unified architecture in `hal-unified-build-claim.md`:

1. **Shapes survive** — polyominoes remain the sole build/claim mechanic.
2. **No structures at all** — clarified user intent, revised design from prior "building auto-claims" to simpler shapes-only.
3. **Single build mode** — `B` key, unified carousel, `Q`/`E` to cycle shapes, `R` to rotate.
4. **Territory = shapes** — expanding territory always via PLACE_SHAPE, no PLACE handler.
5. **HQ exception** — HQ remains as starting structure (kept for spawn logic).

### Outcome
- Design doc: `.squad/decisions/inbox/hal-unified-build-claim.md` (10.7 KB)
- Rationale: Structures added complexity with recipes/crafting/farms/turrets. User simplification = territory expansion via shapes only.
- Team impact: Pemulis (remove structure handlers), Gately (unify UI to shapes), Steeply (cleanup tests).

---

## Decision

**Build system is shapes-only.** PLACE_SHAPE is the sole build handler. PLACE, CRAFT, FARM_HARVEST removed. HQ kept as special structure for starting territory.

**Cascading tasks:**
1. Pemulis: Remove PLACE, CRAFT, FARM_HARVEST handlers and recipe/farming systems.
2. Gately: Remove V key, structure carousel, default click. B key = shapes only.
3. Steeply: Delete tests for structures, crafting, farming. Keep shape/territory tests.

## Next Steps

- Pemulis begins structure removal.
- Gately unifies UI.
- Steeply cleans up tests in parallel.
- Scribe merges decisions and logs session.
