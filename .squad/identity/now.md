# What We're Focused On

Phase 4.5 — HUD Redesign — complete. Canvas resized 800×600 → 600×600; all HUD display migrated from PixiJS to DOM-based side panel (200px right). All 304 tests passing (291 baseline + 13 new HUD state contract tests). 

**Ready for Phase 5 kickoff:** World Events (weather, migration, disasters, ruins, day/night cycle) can begin with confidence in clean layout foundation and validated HUD state contract.
