# Project Context

- **Owner:** dkirby-ms
- **Project:** Primal Grid: Survival of the Frontier — grid-based survival colony builder with dinosaurs, dynamic ecosystems, and base automation in the browser
- **Stack:** TypeScript, HTML5 Canvas, browser-based web game
- **Design Document:** docs/design-sketch.md
- **Created:** 2026-02-25T00:45:00Z

## Current Phase

**Hal (Lead)** has decomposed the design sketch into a **6-phase build plan** (2026-02-25):
- **Phase 0:** Scaffolding (Gately + Pemulis lead)
- **Phase 1–2, 4:** Core simulation, base building, world events (Gately lead)
- **Phase 3:** Creature systems (Gately lead)
- **Phase 5:** Late game + auth (Pemulis lead)

**Your Role (Pemulis):** Systems Dev — lead Phase 0 scaffolding (monorepo, Colyseus, PixiJS, CI) and Phase 5 (persistence, automation). See `.squad/decisions.md` for full architecture.

### Phase 0 — Server & Shared Package Scaffolding (2026-02-25)

- Created `server/` package (`@primal-grid/server`) with Colyseus 0.15+ setup: WebSocketTransport, GameRoom, GameState schema with tick counter, simulation interval at TICK_RATE.
- Created `shared/` package (`@primal-grid/shared`) with types (`ITileState`, `IPlayerState`, `TileType` enum), constants (`TICK_RATE=4`, `DEFAULT_MAP_SIZE=32`, `SERVER_PORT=2567`), and message definitions (`MOVE`, `GATHER` with typed payloads).
- Colyseus 0.15 patterns: `new Server({ transport })`, `@type()` decorator for Schema fields, `setSimulationInterval` for tick loop, `experimentalDecorators` required in tsconfig.
- Both packages use ESM (`"type": "module"`), strict TypeScript, ES2022 target. Server references shared via `tsconfig.json` project references.
- Shared package is pure types/constants — no runtime dependencies. Server imports constants from shared (e.g., `TICK_RATE`, `SERVER_PORT`).
