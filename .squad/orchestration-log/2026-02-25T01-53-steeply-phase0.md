# Orchestration: Steeply Phase 0

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T01:53Z  
**Agent:** Steeply (Tester)  
**Mode:** sync  
**Status:** SUCCESS

## Execution Summary

Phase 0 baseline tests and verification.

### Deliverables

- Root `vitest.config.ts` with cross-package test discovery
- Test files in `shared/src/__tests__/` and `server/src/__tests__/`
- 12 passing tests covering:
  - Types (TileType enum, count)
  - Constants (TICK_RATE, DEFAULT_MAP_SIZE, SERVER_PORT)
  - Messages (MOVE, GATHER, payload types)
  - GameState (instantiation, initial tick)
  - GameRoom (import smoke test)

### Test Coverage

| Module | Tests |
|--------|-------|
| shared: types | 2 |
| shared: constants | 3 |
| shared: messages | 4 |
| server: GameState | 2 |
| server: GameRoom | 1 |
| **Total** | **12** |

### Key Decisions Logged

- Vitest root config with explicit include patterns
- Test file convention: `<package>/src/__tests__/<module>.test.ts`
- No per-workspace vitest configs
- Server tests import source directly (no build step)
- Client tests deferred (manual smoke tests for now)

### Validation

- All 12 tests pass
- Build pipeline verified
- No import issues
- Ready for Phase 1 schema expansion

**Next Phase:** Steeply Phase 1 (player spawning, movement validation, connection tests)
