# Orchestration: Pemulis (Systems Dev)
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T00:50:00Z  
**Session:** Shapes-Only Cleanup  
**Mode:** background  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Task
Strip structures/crafting/farming from server+shared packages to implement Hal's unified shapes-only design.

## What Was Done
- **Removed StructureState class** from server/src/rooms/GameState.ts
- **Removed structures MapSchema** from GameState
- **Removed IStructureState interface** from shared/src/types.ts
- **Removed ItemType.Wall and ItemType.Floor** enum entries
- **Removed structure occupation check** in PLACE_SHAPE handler
- **Removed nextStructureId** from GameRoom and spawnHQ
- **Removed HQ StructureState creation** in territory.ts

## What Was Kept
- ItemType.HQ (for potential future client reference)
- hqX/hqY on PlayerState (HQ spawn point)
- All shape/territory/claiming mechanics
- All creature systems

## Compilation Status
✅ **shared**: builds clean (`npx tsc`)  
✅ **server**: compiles clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`)

## Downstream Work Required
- **Gately:** Client StructureRenderer.ts still references removed systems
- **Steeply:** Tests reference removed systems

## Outcome
HQ is now purely coordinate-based. Shapes are the sole structure build mechanic.
