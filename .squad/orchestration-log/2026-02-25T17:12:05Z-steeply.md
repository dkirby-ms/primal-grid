# Orchestration Log: Steeply

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T17:12:05Z  
**Agent:** Steeply (Tester)  
**Mode:** background (claude-sonnet-4.5)  
**Task:** Tests for Phase 2.3 + Phase 2.5

## Status

**COMPLETE**

## Work Summary

1. **Test Coverage Added**
   - 42 new tests written across server/shared test suites
   - Total test count: 168 passing

2. **Test Categories**

   **Player Survival Tests:**
   - Hunger decrements per tick
   - Health drops at zero hunger
   - Health floors at 1 (no death)
   - EAT message consumes berries, restores hunger
   - Hunger capped at 100

   **Creature AI Tests:**
   - Herbivore FSM transitions (Idle → Wander → Eat → Flee)
   - Carnivore FSM transitions (Wander → Hunt → Eat)
   - Hunger/health tracking on creatures
   - Detection radius behavior
   - Greedy Manhattan movement validation
   - Creature removal on death
   - Creature state string output

   **Biome/Resource Integration:**
   - Creature spawning prefers biomes
   - Grazing depletes resources
   - Resource regen works on timer

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - All tests use existing Vitest config
   - No new linting, building, or testing tools added
   - Server + shared tests only (no client automation per Phase 0)

## Quality Metrics

- **Line coverage:** All critical survival/AI paths covered
- **Edge cases:** Health floor, hunger cap, empty inventory (EAT fails), creature death removal, resource depletion boundaries
- **Regression:** Phase 1 tests (movement, spawning, basic schema) still passing

## Outstanding

- Phase 2.6 integration tests (respawning thresholds)
- Manual smoke tests for visual creature/HUD behavior (Phase 3)

## Notes

- All tests pass against current code
- No flaky tests (deterministic behavior, no async timing issues)
- Test names follow convention: `test("agent does action")` for readability
