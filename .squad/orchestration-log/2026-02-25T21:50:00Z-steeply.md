# Orchestration: Steeply — Phase 3.7 Integration Testing

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T21:50:00Z  
**Agent:** Steeply (Tester)  
**Phase:** 3.7 (Integration Testing)  
**Status:** COMPLETED

## What Was Spawned

Steeply was spawned with this charter:
- Phase 3.7 integration testing in background mode
- Model: claude-sonnet-4.5
- Task: Write 22 new integration tests to verify all Phase 3 gameplay loops

## Work Summary

### Tests Added: 22 new integration tests

1. **Gathering & Crafting Loops**
   - Basic gather → craft → inventory cycle
   - Multi-item crafting (walls, axes, etc.)
   - Recipe validation and cost checking

2. **Placement Mechanics**
   - Wall placement (adjacency, terrain restriction)
   - Floor placement (decorative)
   - Workbench placement (tool crafting location)
   - FarmPlot placement (Grassland/Forest only)

3. **Farm Lifecycle**
   - Growth progression (0-100 ticks)
   - Harvest timing (cropReady flag)
   - Yield calculation based on fertility
   - Repeating harvest cycles

4. **Creature–Structure Interaction**
   - Wall avoidance (creatures pathfind around)
   - Hunt pathing through structures
   - Movement blocking (Wall/Workbench)
   - Floor and FarmPlot walkability

5. **Edge Cases & Validation**
   - Occupied tile rejection
   - Insufficient resource handling
   - Missing inventory fields
   - Biome-specific farm restrictions
   - Non-adjacent harvest rejection
   - Multiplayer race conditions

6. **Ecosystem Stability**
   - 300-tick simulation with mixed structures
   - No regressions in creature or resource behavior

## Outcomes

- **273 total tests passing** (251 existing + 22 new)
- **No bugs found** in Phase 3 implementation
- All gameplay loops verified end-to-end
- Phase 3 definition of done: ACHIEVED

## Key Finding

Harvest yield formula is correct: `Math.max(1, Math.round(3 * fertility))`. Low-fertility tiles yield <3 items as designed.

## Implications

- Phase 3 is **code-complete and test-complete**
- Phase 4 (Creature Systems) can proceed
- No blocking issues for downstream agents
- Handoff: Phase 3.7 → Phase 4 readiness confirmed

## Dependencies Resolved

- ✅ Phase 3.0–3.6 (all implemented and integrated)
- ✅ Full integration test suite (validated)
- ✅ All edge cases handled

## Signals to Team

- **Green light:** Phase 3 stable, tests passing, ready for Phase 4
- **No regressions:** All existing functionality verified
- **Code quality:** Tests reveal comprehensive coverage of Phase 3 gameplay

*Scribe note: Phase 3 work is now officially complete. Team moves forward to Phase 4.*
