**Agent:** Hal (Lead)  
**Task:** Phase 4 scoping, work breakdown, architecture decisions  
**Status:** COMPLETED

## Summary

Hal completed comprehensive Phase 4 scoping for creature systems. Produced:
- **Vision:** Tame wild creatures, breed for traits, command pack behavior
- **Scope fence:** 8 in-scope items, explicit Phase 5 deferrals
- **Work breakdown:** 8 work items (4.1–4.8) across Pemulis (backend), Gately (UI), Steeply (testing)
- **Architecture decisions:** 9 decisions (C1–C9) covering ownership, trust, personality, traits, pack selection, breeding, movement, cost, and decay
- **Dependency graph:** Critical path 5–6 days (Pemulis 4.1→4.4)
- **Definition of done:** 7-point player goal + 300+ test target

## Key Architecture Decisions

| # | Title | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| C1 | Ownership Model — `ownerID` Field | ✅ Ready |
| C2 | Trust as Linear Scalar (0–100) | ✅ Ready |
| C3 | Personality as Enum (Docile/Neutral/Aggressive) | ✅ Ready |
| C4 | Traits as Deltas from Base | ✅ Ready |
| C5 | Pack as Stateful Selection Set Per Player | ✅ Ready |
| C6 | Breeding as Peer Interaction (No Pens) | ✅ Ready |
| C7 | Greedy Movement Persists; A* Stub for Phase 5 | ✅ Ready |
| C8 | Taming Cost — Berries or Meat | ✅ Ready |
| C9 | Trust Decay in Absence (Loneliness Mechanic) | ✅ Ready |

## Dependency Chain

```
4.1 Schema (Pemulis, 1d)
    ├→ 4.2 Taming (Pemulis, 2d) ─→ 4.3 Pack Follow (2d) ─→ 4.4 Breeding (2d)
    └→ 4.5 Tame UI (Gately, 1d) ─→ 4.6 Cmd Binding (1d) ─→ 4.7 Trait Render (1d)
                                                              └→ 4.8 Integration (Steeply, 2d)
```

**Critical path:** 5–6 days (Pemulis chain)

---

## Next Steps

- **Pemulis:** Begin 4.1 (schema taming fields) immediately
- **Gately:** Wait for 4.1 signal, then start 4.5 (Tame UI)
- **Steeply:** Write anticipatory unit tests in parallel, block on 4.1 landing
- **Scribe:** Merge this decision into `.squad/decisions.md`, log kickoff, update agent history
- **Squad:** All agents ready for Phase 4 execution

**Hal's Phase 4 scoping complete. Ready for team execution.**
