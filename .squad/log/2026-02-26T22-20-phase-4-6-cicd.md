# Session Log: Phase 4.6.3 CI/CD Pipeline

**Date:** 2026-02-26T22:20:00Z  
**Agent:** Pemulis  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## What Happened

Pemulis (background mode) implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment to Azure. Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with test gating, Docker build, ACR push, and OIDC-based Container Apps deployment. Wrote `docs/deployment.md` with setup and troubleshooting guide. All 303 tests passing. Workflow ready for staging verification (Phase 4.6.4).

## Files Touched

- **Created:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, `docs/deployment.md`
- **Tests:** All 303 passing

## Key Decisions Logged

- D1: Test gate before deploy (tests must pass before build/push)
- D2: OIDC federated identity (zero-trust auth vs static secrets)
- D3: Single workflow file (clarity, sequential gating)
- D4: ARM64 build target (cost optimization for Container Apps)

## Next Task

Phase 4.6.4 — verify workflow in staging, smoke test Container Apps deployment.
