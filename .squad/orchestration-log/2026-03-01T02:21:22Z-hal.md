# Orchestration Log — Hal (Lead)

**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T02:21:22Z  
**Agent:** Hal (Lead, sync)  
**Topic:** Progression/Leveling System Design

## Scope

Designed and documented the progression/leveling system for Primal Grid:
- 7 levels, with XP awarded per tile claimed (1 XP/tile)
- Shape gating tied to level progression (O/I → T → L → J → S/Z)
- Ability unlocks at levels 6–7 (Pets, Pet Breeding)
- Per-round XP (resets on round start, no persistence)

## Deliverables

- **Decision document:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/hal-progression-design.md`
- **Status:** Proposed → Implementation in progress by team

## Architecture Decisions Documented

| ID  | Decision | Rationale |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| P1  | XP per-round, resets on round start | Arcade rounds 15–30 min; persistent XP adds balance complexity |
| P2  | 7 levels, max ~12 min achievable | Progression is pacing, not grind |
| P3  | Level/XP synced on PlayerState | Client needs for carousel filtering & HUD |
| P4  | Server validates shape access | Client filtering is UX; server is authority |
| P5  | Level-up check at XP grant, not tick loop | Cheaper, instant feedback |
| P6  | PROGRESSION constant in shared | Both server (validation) & client (filtering) use it |
| P7  | Abilities are string flags | Extensible without schema changes |

## Implementation Estimate

~95 lines across 8 files. 1 day implementation, 0.5 day testing.

## Next Steps

- Pemulis: Implement server schema & gating logic
- Gately: Implement client HUD & carousel filtering
- Steeply: Write progression test suite
