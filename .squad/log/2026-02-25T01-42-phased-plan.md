# Session Log: 2026-02-25T01:42Z — Phased Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2026-02-25  
**Topic:** Phased Implementation Plan from GDD  
**Agent:** Hal (Lead)

## Summary

User requested "begin work." Hal decomposed the GDD into an 8-phase implementation plan (Phases 0–7), capturing architecture decisions and team leadership assignments.

## Decisions Finalized

1. **Monorepo:** npm workspaces (client, server, shared)
2. **Rendering:** PixiJS v8 (user directive)
3. **Server:** Colyseus with server-authoritative game state
4. **Simulation:** Tick-based (4 ticks/sec)
5. **State sync:** Viewport-based chunking
6. **AI:** FSM-based creature behavior
7. **Content:** Data-driven (JSON configs in shared package)
8. **Auth:** Separate Express/Fastify service (Phase 7, OAuth/OIDC)
9. **Persistence:** SQLite initially, migration path to Postgres
10. **NPCs:** Basic factions (settlements, trading, disposition only)

## Phase Breakdown

| Phase | Focus | Lead |
|-------|-------|------|
| 0 | Scaffolding | Gately, Pemulis |
| 1 | Walking skeleton (client-server grid) | Gately |
| 2 | Core simulation (creatures, survival) | Gately |
| 3 | Base building (crafting, farming) | Gately, Pemulis |
| 4 | Creature systems (taming, breeding) | Gately |
| 5 | World events (weather, disasters) | Gately |
| 6 | Late game (tech tree, automation) | Pemulis |
| 7 | Auth & NPCs (OAuth, persistence) | Pemulis |

## Scope Fence

Out of scope: modding, aquatic/arctic biomes, mythical creatures, PvP, audio, isometric view, faction diplomacy, tactical combat, DLC, mobile, i18n.

## Principle

Each phase must be playable/demonstrable. Ship the core loop first.
