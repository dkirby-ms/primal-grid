# Orchestration Log: Hal (Lead)

**Date:** 2026-02-25T15:23:41Z  
**Agent:** Hal (Lead)  
**Session Type:** Phase 2 Scoping & Kickoff  
**Mode:** sync  
**Model:** claude-opus-4.6

## Work Summary

Completed Phase 2 scoping and breakdown. Decomposed "living world" vision into 6 ordered work items with clear dependencies, architecture decisions, and acceptance criteria.

### Deliverables

1. **Phase 2 Scoping Document** — `.squad/decisions/inbox/hal-phase2-scoping.md`
   - Current state assessment (Phase 1 completion baseline)
   - Scope fence (what's in Phase 2, what's deferred)
   - 6 ordered work items with owners, dependencies, details
   - 8 architecture decisions with rationale
   - Dependency graph (2.1 feeds 2.2, 2.4; 2.2→2.3; 2.4→2.5; all→2.6)
   - DoD: playable ecosystem loop running 5+ minutes stable

### Items by Owner & Dependency

- **2.1 Biomes & Map Gen** — Pemulis + Gately | No deps
- **2.2 Resources & Gathering** — Pemulis | Depends 2.1
- **2.3 Player Survival (Hunger/Health)** — Pemulis + Gately | Depends 2.2
- **2.4 Creature Schema & Spawning** — Pemulis + Gately | Depends 2.1
- **2.5 Creature AI (FSM)** — Pemulis | Depends 2.4
- **2.6 Ecosystem Integration & Polish** — Pemulis + Gately + Steeply | Depends 2.1–2.5

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **Noise-based procedural generation** (simplex noise, 2-layer: elevation + moisture)
- **Server-only FSM creature AI** (switch on state, decoupled tick rate)
- **Data-driven creature/resource definitions** (JSON in `shared/src/data/`)
- **No pathfinding yet** (greedy Manhattan movement)
- **Flat inventory** (MapSchema<number> on PlayerState)
- **No player death** (health floors at 1)
- **Creature respawn via population threshold**

## Status

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Next Agent:** Pemulis (Systems Dev) — Phase 2.1 implementation
