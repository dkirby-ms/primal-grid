# Orchestration Log: Gately (2026-02-28T19:20:00Z)

**Agent:** Gately (Game Dev)  
**Task:** Remove taming UI and pawn HUD from client  
**Outcome:** SUCCESS

## Summary

Executed removal of taming, pawn, trust, and pack UI/input from client. Wild creature rendering fully preserved.

## Work Completed

### 1. Input Handler Cleanup
- **File:** `client/src/input/InputHandler.ts`
- Removed `CreatureRenderer` type import (only used for taming queries)
- Removed `creatureRenderer` field from InputHandler
- Removed `setCreatureRenderer()` method
- No taming keybindings (I/G/D/Esc) existed in current code — already clean

### 2. Creature Renderer Cleanup
- **File:** `client/src/rendering/CreatureRenderer.ts`
- Removed `localSessionId` field and constructor parameter
- Parameter was used to identify owned pawns
- Removed `followText` DOM element from CreatureEntry (dead pawn-following display)
- Removed `statText` DOM element from CreatureEntry (dead pawn-stats overlay)
- Wild creature rendering preserved: emoji sprites, state indicators (flee/hunt), health-based opacity

### 3. HUD Cleanup
- **File:** `client/src/ui/HudDOM.ts`
- Cleaned "taming info" comment from creature counts section
- Wild creature counts (🦕/🦖) preserved — shows ecosystem population
- No trust bars, pawn selection display, pack counter, or command menu existed in current code

### 4. Main Loop Wiring
- **File:** `client/src/main.ts`
- Removed `input.setCreatureRenderer(creatures)` wiring call
- Updated `CreatureRenderer()` constructor call (no longer passes sessionId)

### 5. HTML Cleanup
- **File:** `client/index.html`
- Cleaned CSS comment from "Creature / Taming" to "Creatures"

## Constructor Signature Change

`CreatureRenderer` is now zero-arg. Any new callers must be updated accordingly.

## Preserved Systems

- Wild creature rendering: type-specific emoji sprites
- Behavior state indicators: flee, hunt, graze display on creatures
- Health-based opacity feedback for wild creatures
- All territory/building/shape UI completely untouched

## Test Status

Client code compiles clean:
- `tsc --noEmit` passes
- No runtime errors
- No related test failures

## Impact on Other Agents

- **Pemulis (Systems Dev):** Server-side wild creature data still flows to client; rendering unchanged
- **Steeply (Tester):** No new test failures from client-side cleanup
