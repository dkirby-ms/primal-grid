## Input

- **Task:** Phase 3 scoping & work breakdown
- **Dependency:** Phase 2 (194 tests, merged)
- **Output Artifact:** `.squad/decisions/inbox/hal-phase3-scoping.md`

## Output

**Scoping Document Generated:**
- 7 work items decomposed with dependency graph
- Architecture decisions (8 total, B1–B8)
- Scope fence with 12 explicitly deferred features
- Definition of Done: playable Phase 3 (gather → craft → build → farm loop)

**Work Items:**
1. 3.1 — Recipe & Item Data Definitions (Pemulis, 0 deps)
2. 3.2 — Inventory Extension & Craft Handler (Pemulis, depends 3.1)
3. 3.3 — Structure Schema & Placement (Pemulis, depends 3.2)
4. 3.4 — Farm System (Pemulis, depends 3.3)
5. 3.5 — Client: Structure & Farm Rendering (Gately, depends 3.3, 3.4)
6. 3.6 — Client: Inventory HUD & Build Mode (Gately, depends 3.2, 3.5)
7. 3.7 — Integration Testing & Polish (Steeply + Pemulis + Gately, depends 3.1–3.6)

**Parallelism Identified:**
- 3.1 can start immediately (Pemulis)
- 3.5 can start once 3.3 schema defined (Gately parallel to 3.4)
- Steeply writes unit tests alongside each work item
