# Phase 3 Integration Kickoff

**Date:** 2026-02-25T21:46:00Z  
**Scope:** Base Building Systems (Phase 3.1–3.6)

## Summary

Phase 3 decision documents merged from inbox:
- **Phase 3.1–3.4** (Pemulis): Server-side base building systems — recipes, inventory, structures, farms.
- **Phase 3.5+3.6** (Gately): Client rendering and HUD — structures, inventory display, build mode, craft menu.

Both decisions are now active and define the scope for Phase 3 integration. Pemulis and Gately can begin implementation in parallel after Steeply completes Phase 2 testing. All work items (3.1–3.7) are tracked in decisions.md.

## Agents Involved

- **Pemulis (Systems Dev)** — 3.1–3.4 implementation (recipes, crafting, structures, farms)
- **Gately (Game Dev)** — 3.5–3.6 implementation (rendering, HUD, build mode)
- **Steeply (Tester)** — Integration testing (3.7), cross-agent validation

## Next Phase

Steeply completes Phase 2 integration testing (3.7 background spawn). Upon completion, Pemulis and Gately begin Phase 3 work items in parallel.
