# Phase 3 Kickoff: Base Building

**Date:** 2026-02-25T17:45:00Z  
**Milestone:** Phase 3 scoping complete  
**Status:** Ready for team execution

---

## Summary

Phase 2 (Core Simulation) delivered a living world with procedural maps, resources, creatures, and player survival (194 tests, merged). Phase 3 builds the building system: crafting, structures, and farming.

**7 work items.** 3 agents. ~3-week sprint.

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Flat inventory model** — ItemType fields on PlayerState (walls, floors, axes, etc.)
2. **1-tile structures** — Wall, Floor, Workbench only; multi-tile deferred
3. **Data-driven recipes** — TypeScript constants in shared; 6 initial recipes
4. **Farm as structure subtype** — Growth fields on StructureState; leverage tile fertility
5. **Tool bonus passive** — Owning an Axe = +1 wood yield; no equip/unequip
6. **Adjacency validation** — Player must be on or next to target tile for PLACE/FARM_HARVEST

## Work Breakdown

| Item | Owner | Start | Prereq |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 3.1 Data | Pemulis | Week 1 | — |
| 3.2 Craft | Pemulis | Week 1 | 3.1 |
| 3.3 Schema | Pemulis | Week 2 | 3.2 |
| 3.4 Farm | Pemulis | Week 2 | 3.3 |
| 3.5 Render | Gately | Week 2 | 3.3 |
| 3.6 HUD | Gately | Week 3 | 3.5 |
| 3.7 Test | Steeply | Week 3 | 3.1–3.6 |

---

## Parallelism

- **Pemulis:** 3.1 → 3.2 (Week 1) → 3.3 → 3.4 (Week 2)
- **Gately:** (waiting) → 3.5 (Week 2, once 3.3 schema) → 3.6 (Week 3)
- **Steeply:** Unit tests alongside each item; integration 3.7 (Week 3)

---

## Definition of Done

Player can:
1. Gather → Craft Axe → Get +1 wood yield
2. Gather → Craft Walls → Place to block movement
3. Place Farm Plot on grassland → Watch grow → Harvest berries
4. See full inventory in HUD
5. Toggle build mode to place structures

World remains stable. 194 + Phase 3 tests pass.
