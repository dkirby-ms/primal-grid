# Session Log: Phase 4 Kickoff

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T22:48:00Z  
**Topic:** Phase 4 (Creature Systems) kickoff — Taming, Breeding, Pack Commands  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

---

## What Happened

- **Hal (Completed):** Produced comprehensive Phase 4 scoping (9 architecture decisions, 8 work items, full dependency graph, definition of done)
- **Pemulis (In Progress):** Phase 4.1 + 4.2 schema design + taming interaction logic; establishing backend foundation
- **Steeply (In Progress):** Anticipatory unit test suite for taming cycle, trust system, breeding logic, pack commands
- **Gately:** Waiting on Phase 4.1 signal to begin UI work (4.5 Tame UI)

---

## Decisions Made

All **9 architecture decisions (C1–C9)** merged from hal-phase4-scoping.md:

| Decision | Headline |
|----------|----------|
| **C1** | Ownership Model — `ownerID` field (null = wild, playerID = owned) |
| **C2** | Trust as Linear Scalar (0–100); ≥70 = obedient) |
| **C3** | Personality as Enum (Docile/Neutral/Aggressive) |
| **C4** | Traits as Deltas from Base (Speed, Health, HungerDrain) |
| **C5** | Pack as Stateful Selection Set Per Player (max 8) |
| **C6** | Breeding as Peer Interaction (no pens required) |
| **C7** | Greedy Movement Persists; A* Stub for Phase 5 |
| **C8** | Taming Cost — Berries or Meat |
| **C9** | Trust Decay in Absence (Loneliness Mechanic) |

## Work Breakdown

| Item | Owner | Timeline | Prereq |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| **4.1** Schema: Tame Fields | Pemulis | 1d | — |
| **4.2** Taming Interaction | Pemulis | 2d | 4.1 |
| **4.3** Pack Follow & Commands | Pemulis | 2d | 4.2 |
| **4.4** Breeding Logic | Pemulis | 2d | 4.1, 4.2 |
| **4.5** Client Tame UI | Gately | 1d | 4.1 |
| **4.6** Creature Command Binding | Gately | 1d | 4.5 |
| **4.7** Trait Rendering & HUD | Gately | 1d | 4.5 |
| **4.8** Integration & A* Prep | Steeply | 2d | 4.1–4.7 |

**Critical path:** 5–6 days (Pemulis 4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4)

## Success Criteria (Definition of Done)

Player must be able to:

1. ✅ **Encounter and tame a creature** — I key, costs 1 berry, trust starts at 0
2. ✅ **Build trust through feeding** — Visible trust bar, obeys at ≥70
3. ✅ **Command a pack to follow** — F key, 1–8 creatures, visual feedback
4. ✅ **Breed two creatures** — Adjacent, trust≥70, same owner, same type → B key → offspring
5. ✅ **See creature stats** — Tooltip: Speed, Health, Hunger drain (traits visible)
6. ✅ **Hybrid gameplay** — Tame pack + use as allies + breed for better offspring
7. ✅ **Ecosystem stable** — 273 tests pass, wild creatures still spawn, tamed coexist
8. ✅ **Playable & demonstrable** — 15-minute demo: gather berries → tame → trust → breed → follow → defend

## Blockers / Dependencies

- **Pemulis 4.1** must land before Gately & Steeply can fully proceed (schema is prerequisite)
- **Phase 3** must remain stable (273 tests passing)
- No external API blockers identified

---

## Next 24 Hours

- **Pemulis:** Submit 4.1 schema + 4.2 taming handler PR
- **Steeply:** Complete anticipatory test suite (ready to run when 4.1 lands)
- **Gately:** Review schema design, prep 4.5 UI scaffolding
- **Scribe:** Monitor PR merges, log architecture decisions, propagate updates across agent history

**Phase 4 kicked off 2026-02-25T22:48:00Z. Team executing on schedule.**
