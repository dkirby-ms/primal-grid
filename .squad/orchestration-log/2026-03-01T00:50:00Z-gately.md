# Orchestration: Gately (Game Dev)
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T00:50:00Z  
**Session:** Shapes-Only Cleanup  
**Mode:** background  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Task
Remove CraftMenu and StructureRenderer from client, clean all UI references per shapes-only design.

## What Was Done
- **Deleted CraftMenu.ts** — entire file (craft overlay UI, recipe display, `canCraft` affordability)
- **Deleted StructureRenderer.ts** — entire file (PixiJS rendering of walls, floors, workbenches, farm plots, HQ)
- **Cleaned main.ts** — removed CraftMenu/StructureRenderer imports, instantiation, room binding
- **Cleaned InputHandler.ts** — removed CraftMenu refs, C-key toggle, H-key farm harvest, craft number-key handler
- **Cleaned HudDOM.ts** — removed workbench/farm count display
- **Cleaned index.html** — removed "Crafted Items" HUD section

## What Was Kept
- B-key build mode toggle, Q/E shape cycling, R rotation, number-key shape selection
- PLACE_SHAPE message sending, shape ghost preview
- Shape carousel in HUD, territory display, resource inventory, creature counts
- HQ display logic (now via GridRenderer territory overlays)

## Compilation Status
✅ **client**: compiles clean

## Outcome
Build mode is purely shape-based. No structure placement paths remain in client code.
