## Outcome

**Status:** SUCCESS

**Summary:** Produced 8-phase implementation plan (Phase 0–7) decomposing user GDD. Architecture decisions written to inbox. Agent history updated.

**Key Decisions:**
- Monorepo with npm workspaces (client, server, shared)
- PixiJS v8 for rendering (user directive: no Phaser)
- Colyseus for server-authoritative game state
- Tick-based simulation (4 ticks/sec configurable)
- Viewport-based state sync (Phase 2+)
- Scope fence: no modding, PvP, audio, isometric, faction diplomacy, tactical combat, DLC, mobile, i18n
