# Session Log: Phase 2 Complete

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T17:18:18Z  
**Status:** Phase 2 — Core Simulation (FULLY COMPLETE)

## Overview

All 6 Phase 2 work items (2.1–2.6) are complete on branch `feature/p2-living-world`.  
The game now has a fully functional, self-sustaining ecosystem with creature AI, resource management, and player survival mechanics.

## Work Items Completed

| Item | Title | Deliverable | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **2.1** | Procedural Map Generation | Noise-based biome generation with 8 tile types | ✅ DONE |
| **2.2** | Resource System & Gathering | Tiles spawn resources (Wood, Stone, Fiber, Berries), player gathers | ✅ DONE |
| **2.3** | Player Survival | Hunger/health tracking, EAT action restores hunger | ✅ DONE |
| **2.4** | Creature Schema & Spawning | Herbivore/Carnivore creatures spawn per biome, ~20 total on 32×32 | ✅ DONE |
| **2.5** | Creature AI (FSM) | Idle/Wander/Eat/Hunt/Flee states, hunger depletion, detection radius | ✅ DONE |
| **2.6** | Ecosystem Integration | Respawning, grazing-resource loop, food chain, 5+ min stability | ✅ DONE |

## Definition of Done (Met)

- ✅ Procedurally generated map with distinct biome regions
- ✅ Herbivore creatures wander and graze in grasslands
- ✅ Carnivore creatures hunt herbivores in forests
- ✅ Resources on tiles can be gathered by player
- ✅ Hunger bar depletes, restored by eating berries
- ✅ World sustains itself for 5+ minutes without intervention
- ✅ 194 tests passing (Phase 0 baseline: 12 → Phase 2: 194)

## Orchestration Log

Three orchestration logs written:
- `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-02-25T17:18:18Z-pemulis.md`
- `.squad/orchestration-log/2026-02-25T17:18:18Z-gately.md`

## Decision Inbox Merged

Two inbox decision files merged into `decisions.md` and deleted:
- ~~`.squad/decisions/inbox/pemulis-creature-respawn.md`~~
