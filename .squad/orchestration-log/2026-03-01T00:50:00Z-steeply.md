# Orchestration: Steeply (Tester)
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T00:50:00Z  
**Session:** Shapes-Only Cleanup  
**Mode:** background  
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

## Task
Clean up structure/crafting/farming test references to compile suite after server/client cleanup.

## What Was Done
- **player-lifecycle.test.ts** — removed `structures.size` assertion, replaced with HQ position + score check
- **territory.test.ts** — removed `structures.forEach` HQ lookup, `ItemType` import, `nextStructureId` from helper, replaced with `isWalkable` check
- **hud-state-contract.test.ts** — removed `nextStructureId = 0` from helper
- No test files deleted (Phase 3 test files already absent)

## What Was Kept
- All shape/territory tests (PLACE_SHAPE, adjacency, score tracking)
- All creature/AI/ecosystem tests
- All procedural map generation tests
- All HUD state contract tests

## Test Status
✅ 150/151 tests pass (1 pre-existing flaky test, unrelated to cleanup)

## Outcome
Zero references to removed systems remain. Suite compiles clean.
