# Orchestration Log: Steeply (Tester)

**Date:** 2026-02-25T15:23:41Z  
**Agent:** Steeply (Tester)  
**Session Type:** Phase 2.1 — Test Suite Expansion  
**Mode:** background  
**Model:** claude-sonnet-4.5

## Work Summary

Expanded test suite to cover Phase 2.1 deliverables. Added 30 new tests for biome types and procedural map generation. All tests pass; no regressions.

### Test Coverage Added

#### Biome Type Tests (8 tests)
- Biome enum has all 8 types
- Biome colors defined for all types
- Fallback color for unknown types
- Walkability rules: Water/Rock impassable, others walkable

#### Procedural Map Generation Tests (22 tests)
- Map generation produces correct dimensions (32×32)
- Noise distribution across elevation/moisture ranges
- Seed determinism (same seed = identical maps)
- Different seeds produce different maps
- Biome thresholding produces expected distribution
- Fertility correlates with biome type
- Moisture values vary across map
- Edge cases:
  - Maps with extreme elevation distribution
  - Maps with extreme moisture distribution
  - Maps with all walkable tiles
  - Maps with water/rock distribution
- Tile properties (fertility, moisture) within valid ranges (0–1)
- Generator function handles arbitrary width/height
- Seed propagation through GameState

### Metrics

- **Phase 0/1 tests:** 12 passing (no regressions)
- **Phase 2.1 biome tests:** 8 passing
- **Phase 2.1 procedural map tests:** 22 passing
- **Total:** 42 tests passing

### Test Quality Standards

- Tests use dynamic tile scanning (not hardcoded coordinates)
- Multiple seeds tested for determinism
- Distribution checks use statistical thresholds
- Edge cases explicitly covered
- All assertions have descriptive messages

## Status

**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Test Count:** 42 passing  
**Coverage:** Biome types + procedural map generation  
**Regressions:** None  
**Next Phase:** Phase 2.2 (Resources & Gathering) — Steeply will expand test suite for resource system
