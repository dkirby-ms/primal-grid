### 2026-02-27T02:52Z: User directives — territory & economy redesign
**By:** dkirby-ms (via Copilot)
**What:**
1. Players start with 1 free worker pawn that roams around collecting wood and other resources
2. Remove the explicit claim territory mechanic — territory claims happen automatically when a player constructs something on a tile
3. Replace walls/floors with tetris-like shapes that can be placed to control territory

**Why:** User request — the wood economy is broken (players softlock when out of wood with no active gather mechanic). These three changes redesign the core loop: workers gather resources, players spend resources on tetris shapes, shapes grant territory when placed.
